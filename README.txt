This MATLAB codes simulates deterministic or randomized version of 2D Euler and Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) models.
The random dynamics is based on LU and SALT frameworks.
Several parameterisations are available.

Launch the script main.m to execute the algorithm.
Plots and MAT-files are saved each day of simulation in the folder images.

Several parameters can be changed easily in the beginning of the script main.m.
